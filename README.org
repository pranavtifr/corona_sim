* Corona Virus Simulation
**  Rules of the Simulation
   - Periodic Boundary Conditions
   - Non Interacting particles with fixed velocities
   - Initially 10 particles are infected
   - Particles spread infection with 100% probability when too close
   - Noone Dies or recovers
   - At each time step 10% probability to recover and 0.4% probability to die
     
**  To - Do
   - Social Distancing with a force law

** Results
